    Just include this module, and the garbage-collector is functional.

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       By using this module, a small number of nodes inside Y.Node._instances will periodically be inspected whether they are still part of the DOM. If not, they will be removed using Node.destroy(true);
    </p>

<h2>Background information</h2>
    <p>
       If you develop a webapp, you should take care of memory management of the Nodes. However, in many cases you -or some module- might cleanup a parent-node without realizing some of its child nodes are cached inside Y.Node.instances.
    </p>
    <p>
        This can easily occur when you do just <code>Y.one('#someinnernode')</code> (creating a Node-refference) - and later on: <code>Y.one('#parentcontainer').setHTML('some new content')</code>.
    </p>

<h2>Precaution</h2>
    <p>
        1. When using Y.App, you need to set <code>preserve: false</code> for all its views. Should these set <code>true</code> then Y.App keeps referring to the view's node-instance while at the same time they will be removed from the DOM. The node-garbage-collector will destroy those instances resulting into an error when Y.Apps is going to show these views again.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Because node instances inside Y.Node._instances are checked for their presence inside the DOM, you could run into problems when your code is using <code>Y.Node.create()</code> <u>without inserting this node in the DOM</u>. You should insert these instances synchronously, or asynchronously within 2 seconds. After 2 seconds they are marked to be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. When using this module, do not cache and reuse Nodes which you know that will leave the DOM temporarely. For the same reason as 1.
