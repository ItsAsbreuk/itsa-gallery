/**
 *
 * Extention ITSAModellistSyncPromise
 *
 *
 * Extends Y.ModelList with Promised sync-methods. The ModelList's synclayer can be made just as usual, defining the 'read' method.
 * But instead of calling ModelList.load you can use:
 *
 * <b>ModelList.loadPromise</b>
 *
 * <b>ModelList's sync-layer MUST call the callback-function of its 'read' promise-method, otherwise loadPromise is not resolved.</b>
 *
 *
 * Also, there are 3 extra Promises, which -in this current version- <b>all depends</b> on the Model's synclayer, not ModelLists synclayer:

 * <b>ModelList.destroyPromise</b>
 * <b>ModelList.savePromise</b>
 * <b>ModelList.submitPromise</b>
 *
 * <b>Model's sync-layer MUST call the callback-function of its related promises-method,
 * otherwise destroyPromise, savePromise and submitPromise are not resolved.</b>

         * make the promise work.

        * save operation will fire an `error` event with the `src` value "submit".
